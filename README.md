# Snake Game
A browser-based Snake game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where the player controls the snake to collect items and increase their score while avoiding collisions.

## Project Overview
This project recreates the classic Snake game using JavaScript logic to control movement, collision detection, and score progression. The game updates dynamically based on user input and game state.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Key Features
- Keyboard-controlled snake movement
- Collision detection with walls and the snake’s own body
- Dynamic score and snake growth
- Continuous game loop logic

## Learning Approach

I built this project by following and learning from YouTube tutorials alongside independent experimentation. I focused on understanding the logic behind each part of the game rather than copying code, and adapted sections to improve my understanding of movement, loops, and conditionals.

## What I Learned
- Using JavaScript functions, loops, and conditionals to control game logic  
- Handling keyboard input and real-time updates  
- Breaking down a larger problem into smaller, manageable parts  
- Debugging and modifying existing code to improve functionality  

## Possible Improvements
- Add difficulty levels or adjustable speed
- Improve styling and responsiveness
- Completing the project independently
